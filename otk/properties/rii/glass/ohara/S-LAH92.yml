COMMENTS: "S-LAH92 is a tantalum-free optical glass recommended for polished lens blank applications. Located in the same extensively used area as S-LAH58 with potential for increased demand, S-LAH92 provides significant cost reduction and also features low specific gravity.<br>Refractive index is relative to air at standard conditions; Wavelength in dispersion formula is as measured in air and expressed in micrometers."
