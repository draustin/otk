COMMENTS: "S-FPL55 is an optical glass featuring very low dispersion, simlar to S-FPL53, with the advantage of improved polishing characteristics. This new glass type has better abrasion values.<br>Refractive index is relative to air at standard conditions; Wavelength in dispersion formula is as measured in air and expressed in micrometers."
